## Carrot Island Restoration Project
### __*Grace Loonam, Master's Thesis*__
### Practical Computing, Fall 2024


#### Project Background
Oyster reefs at Carrot Island in the Rachel Carson Reserve, Beaufort, North 
Carolina, were restored in 2018 with multiple restoration approaches in order to test 
various substrates and their capacity to restore oyster reef habitat compared to 
nearby natural reefs in the area. Former members of the Blakeslee and Gittman labs 
(Christopher Moore and Emory Wellman) conducted a variety of biodiversity and habitat 
surveys and analyses to quantify the immediate changes that developed at these sites 
for up to two years post-restoration by comparing the conditions at these later time 
points to what they measured prior to the implementation of the restoration plots. 

With my master's work, I am following up on their projects now that it has been five 
years since the reefs were restored, as we are interested in seeing how these 
conditions may have changed even further with additional time post restoration. For the purposes of this project, I was specifically interested in looking at two particular response variables that they also evaluated: trematode diversity in the Eastern mudsnail, (_Ilyanassa obsoleta_) and oyster density by restoration treatment. I hypothesized that trematode diversity would be higher five years post restoration at the restored sites than at their unrestored counterparts, and that oyster densities would be higher than they were at the last time they were measured (2020). In terms of restoration treatment, I predicted that the novel breakwater substrate (OysterCatcherTM) would possess greater oyster densities than the more traditional restoration approach (shell bags) as the latter technique has had mixed results in previous applications. 

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of these two restoration treatments in comparison to one another as well as relative to unrestored plots using multiple evaluation metrics in order to get a clear idea of how well this restoration is doing five years post restoration (additionally relative to early monitoring results). This can help inform what restoration approaches should be implemented in the future as well as where these approaches should be put in place, based off of the results of my work. I am also interested in seeing how longer term monitoring compares to initial monitoring to help guide future restoration initiatives in their implementation/follow through, as these long term results are critical to consider for the effective restoration of this vitally imporatant organism and the habitat they provide.
