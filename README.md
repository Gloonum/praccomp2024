## Carrot Island Restoration Project
### __*Grace Loonam, Master's Thesis*__
### Practical Computing, Fall 2024


	Oyster reefs at Carrot Island in the Rachel Carson Reserve, Beaufort, North 
Carolina, were restored in 2018 with multiple restoration approaches in order to test 
various substrates and their capacity to restore oyster reef habitat compared to 
nearby natural reefs in the area. Former members of the Blakeslee and Gittman labs 
(Christopher Moore and Emory Wellman) conducted a variety of biodiversity and habitat 
surveys and analyses to quantify the immediate changes that developed at these sites 
for up to two years post-restoration by comparing the conditions at these later time 
points to what they measure prior to the implementation of the restoration plots.  
With my master's work, I am following up on their projects now that it has been five 
years since the reefs were restored, as we are interested in seeing how these 
conditions may have changed even further with additional time post restoration.

	For the purposes of this project, I was specifically interested in
